</p> # Wallet 
A DID-first personal digital wallet that brings the Web3 experience into everyday life.

Prodao Wallet is built around decentralized identity (DID) — a way to own and control your digital identity without relying on centralized providers. Within a single wallet, users can create and manage multiple DID-based profiles and use them to hold assets, connect across compatible Web3 networks, and have end-to-end encrypted, blockchain-backed private conversations and social interactions.

Developed by PRODAO on the Prodao mainnet and compatible Web3 networks, Prodao Wallet focuses on trust, real data ownership, and a secure, familiar experience, bringing Web3-powered finance and communication into everyday life. It is currently under active development and will be released publicly soon.

## Vision

Prodao Wallet is not just a digital wallet. It aims to serve as the trust layer for the Web3 era.

Our vision can be summarized in three pillars:

- **DID-centric trust layer**  
  Build a trust layer anchored in decentralized identity (DID), enabling verifiable, user-controlled identities across networks and applications.

- **Seamless integration of data sovereignty into daily life**  
  Make self-sovereign data ownership an invisible part of everyday finance, communication, and online interactions, so users can benefit from Web3 without sacrificing usability or control.

- **The Web3 gateway connecting enterprises and individuals**  
  Provide a secure, interoperable gateway where enterprises and individuals can meet, transact, and collaborate using shared Web3-native primitives such as DIDs, verifiable credentials, and on-chain messaging.

## Key Features

Prodao Wallet is designed to highlight both technical advantages (E2EE, Layer 1) and business value (verifiable credentials, asset management) from the very first release.

### DID-first multi-profile management

- Create and manage multiple DID-based profiles from a single wallet.  
- Separate identities by purpose (personal, work, projects, etc.) while maintaining self-sovereign control over each profile and its data.

### E2EE private P2P messaging

- End-to-end encrypted, blockchain-backed private peer-to-peer chats tightly integrated with DID-based instant token transfers.  
- Designed as a core “killer app” that combines secure communication and value transfer in one seamless experience.

### Trust-verified credential (VC) management

- Securely store, verify, and present verifiable credentials (VCs) inside the wallet.  
- Forms the foundation of a B2B-oriented trust ecosystem where organizations and individuals can exchange verified information without relying on centralized intermediaries.

### Integrated asset & swap

- Manage PROD, the native token of the PRODAO mainnet, alongside assets from compatible networks.  
- Provides an integrated view of holdings and on-chain activity, with swap capabilities aligned with the Prodao Wallet roadmap and compliance requirements.

### High-performance Layer 1 foundation

- Built on the Prodao mainnet as a high-performance Layer 1 with fast and stable transaction processing.
- Optimized for identity, messaging, and everyday financial interactions, rather than speculative-only use cases.

## Repository Overview

This repository is the official public-facing home of Prodao Wallet by PRODAO.

It is intended to:

- Introduce the vision and core concepts behind Prodao Wallet.
- Provide public, user-facing documents such as legal policies and version information.
- Serve as a stable reference point for external users, developers, and partners who want to understand how Prodao Wallet works and evolves.

At this stage, the repository includes:

- [`privacy-policy.html`](./privacy-policy.html) – the official privacy policy governing how user data is collected, used, and protected within Prodao Wallet.
- [`terms-of-service.html`](./terms-of-service.html) – the official terms and conditions for using Prodao Wallet and related services.
- [`versioning.json`](./versioning.json) – a machine-readable manifest that tracks current and/or latest application versions, enabling clients and services to reference the most up-to-date builds.

As the project evolves, this repository may be expanded with:

- Additional public product and technical documentation (e.g., `docs/`)
- Integration and API guides
- Public-facing specifications for identity, messaging, and verifiable credentials
- Branding and communication assets that are safe to share externally

All content in this repository is intended for external audiences and reflects the official public positioning of PRODAO and the Prodao Wallet project.
